```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML5, Tailwind CSS,JavaScript
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations and dark mode
* **AI Simulation**: Mock responses demonstrating AI capabilities
* **No Backend**: Pure frontend implementation for hackathon demo

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download** the project files
2. **Open `index.html`** in any modern web browser
3. **Click "🚀 Start Learning"** to access the main application
4. **Paste content** in the input area and click **"Explain with AI"**

### Quick Test Examples

Try these examples to see AI Tutor in action:

**JavaScript Function:**

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
    return n <= 1 ? n : fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
}
```

**Python Algorithm:**

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

**Concept Question:**

```
What are closures in JavaScript and how do they work?
```
